# JavaScript30

In this repository, I will be documenting my progress through the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos. This course is a free 30 day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge. Each day, I will be exploring concepts and use cases without the use of JS frameworks or libraries. Included in each folder are the solutions as presented in videos by Wes on the JavaScript30 website (filenames with the '-SOLUTION' suffix), as well as my own solutions. Thanks to @wesbos for providing this awesome course!
