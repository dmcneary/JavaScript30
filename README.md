# JavaScript30

In this repository, I will be documenting my progress through the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos. This course is a free 30 day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge. Each day, I will be exploring concepts and use cases without the use of JS frameworks or libraries. Included in each folder are my own solutions, as well as the solutions as presented in the videos by Wes (filenames with the '-SOLUTION' suffix). Thanks to @wesbos for providing this awesome course!
